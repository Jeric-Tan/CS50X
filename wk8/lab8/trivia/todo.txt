CAN TRANSFORM IT INTO A DYNAMIC TRIVIA WEBSITE

//MCQ PORTION
NOW IT ONLY WORKS FOR 1 QUESTION
NEED TO FIND SOME WAY TO NOT LET *ALL* THE BUTTONS RESET, BUT ONLY THE BUTTONS ON THE SAME QUESTION RESET
probs something to do with class/custom tags i think


//OE PORTION
RIGHT NOW ITS HARD CODED FOR ONE QUESTION
MAYBE CAN USE A LIST OR DICT TO STORE THE QN NUMBER AND ITS ANSWER THEN USE A LOOP OR SMTH
MAYBE use more classes idk since classes arnt iterables cant put placeholders inside (I THINK?)
