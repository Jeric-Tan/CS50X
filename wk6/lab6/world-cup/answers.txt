Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
None of the predictions proved incorrect. The results are consistent with my predictions - the larger
the number of simulations ran, the longer the time taken to run the program.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
If i am charged for each second, then using 100,000 simulation would be "good enough" as for the same
price, more simulations can be ran and more accurate the results can be generated
