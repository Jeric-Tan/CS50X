The user's audio aura is one that is more solemn with moderate danceability and energy.

The way the average is calculated assumes that the listener listens to their top 100 songs for the same duration.
Hence a better way could be to factor in the amount of time the listener spent listening to the songs and determine
a respective weightage given to a song's energy, valence and danceability which contributes to the final average.
