## Flow of the Game
<ul>
    <li>When the game starts, players are given 14 random tiles.
    <li>Each turn a random tile would be drawn.
    <li>Players would need to decide if they want to keep the newly drawn tile or discard the drawn tile.
        <ul>
            <li>If they decide to keep the newly drawn tile, the tile would replace the discarded tile chosen by the player.
            <li>While if they decide to discard the drawn tile, there would be no changes to the hand and the next turn begins.
        </ul>
    <li>At the end, the player's score would be the number of turns they took to win the game.
</ul>
